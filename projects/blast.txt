Blowing up stuff is fun!
In astrophysics, blast waves are common, e.g., around supernovae explosions.

Use ` --prob blast` and the input files `athinput.blast` and / or `athinput.blast_sph` in the `input/` directory (depending whether you like Cartesian or spherical coordinates more...).

Some things to try:
(1) Is the propagation as expected?
(2) Is the inner / outer profile as expected?
(3) Do things behave they should if you change the pressure / the EoS / the gas / ...?
(4) Any numerical problems you encounter...?
