Waves are an essential component to fluid dynamics.

This project focuses on sound waves and the equation of state. Use the input file `inputs/athinput.linear_wave1d` in this folder, compile Athena++ with the `--prob linear_wave` parameter and consider:
(1) changing the equation of state (see ./configure -h); focus on isothermal and adiabatic eos
(2) change the speed of sound (with the `gamma` or `iso_sound_speed` parameters)
(3) modify the amplitude of the wave using the (`amp`) parameter

Is the propagation as expected?

You might also consider
(a) giving the background a fixed flow (using the `vflow` parameter)
(b) increasing the runtime (`tlim`)
(c) change the number of grid cells (`mesh/nx1`)

When does the code "break", i.e., deviate from your expectation?
