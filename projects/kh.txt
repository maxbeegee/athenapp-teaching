The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is probably the most well-known hydrodynamical instability.
And it plays a pivotal role in astrophysics!

Compile Athena++ with `--prob kh`. Use the input file `athinput.kh` found in the `inputs/` folder.

When is the setup stable / unstable?
How fast does the perturbation grow? Does that match what you expect?
How do things change with changed flow speed / overdensity?
What do you notice when you in/decrease the resolution?
