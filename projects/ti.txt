Thermal instability. Cool stuff.

Compile Athena++ with the `--probe ti` switch and use the `athinput.ti` input file.

When does the instability occur?
How fast does it grow?
Check especially for "realistic" cooling curve slopes.
Is that in accordance with your expectations?

Note: the cooling / heating routine is very rudimentary, so use a `cfl_number` so that the timestep is smaller than your cooling time.
