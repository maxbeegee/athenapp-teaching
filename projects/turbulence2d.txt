Turbulence in 2D might seem like a mathematical curiosity but is actually relevant in many (astro)physical situations.

Use the `--prob turb -fft` compile option and the `input/athinput.turb` file. Modify the input file from 3D to 2D (set the `nx` and size parameters accordingly).

Some suggestions:
- If you continuously stir (iprob=2 with a reasonable dtdrive and tcorr), how long does it take to reach steady state? Does it ever?
- What is the main difference from the expected 3D behavior?
