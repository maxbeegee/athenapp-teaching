Disks can be found around (forming) stars, planets, supermassive black holes, ...

For this project use the `--prob disk  --coord=cylindrical` compile option and the `athinput.disk` file in the input directory.

Some ideas:
Is the disk stable?
What is its profile?
Is there an accretion flux?
How does this all compare to your theoretical expectations?
