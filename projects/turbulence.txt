Turbulence -- the last unsolved problem of classical physics

Use the `--prob turb -fft` compile option and the `input/athinput.turb` file.

Some suggestions:
- How long does it take for the turbulence to decay?
- Or if you continuously stir (iprob=2 with a reasonable dtdrive and tcorr), how long does it take to reach steady state? Does it ever?
- What is the final Mach number you achieve?
- If you choose to use an adiabatic EoS, how fast does the medium get hotter?
- Check out the kinetic energy power spectrum!
